# RDDB (Raw Deal Database)
I thought a great way to practice CRUD functionality while also practicing the MERN stack would be to create a card game database and a way to display the data. Magic: The Gathering already has a great website to do this (Scryfall) so I decided to reach back into my teenage years and create one for my favorite defunct WWE trading card game, WWE Raw Deal.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Mongoose, Express, React, Node, Tailwind CSS

I started by just creating a basic API server which would return the card data in JSON format, and decided to build a front end on top of it that took the data and converted it to something that looks like the real card.  I chose TailwindCSS because I was very curious about trying the library out. I greatly enjoyed how easy it made styling the page.  It was also the first time I attempted pagination, and getting that to work was a lot of very interesting challenges.  

## Lessons Learned:

BIGGEST LESSON LEARNED: Do not create your entire front end using defunct technology, because when you go to push it to Heroku it will not work.  That was a frustrating wall to run into, and I intend to eventually convert the front end into something not using Create-React-App, but for now it will just live on VSCode in it's CRA glory.
